                            Hey there! I'm Kelly Johnson, your friendly neighborhood dog walker and pet sitter. 
                            Growing up surrounded by pets, I've turned my love for animals into a full-time gig. 
                            With a degree in Animal Behavior Science, I've got a knack for understanding what our 
                            furry friends need.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I pride myself on personalized care, whether it's a morning stroll or a cozy night in. 
                            Beyond the leash, you'll find me organizing local dog playdates and volunteering at 
                            the animal shelter. I'm not just a pet sitter; I'm a genuine friend to every pet I meet.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let's make some pawsitive memories together! üêæ
